Windows SOAR and EDR Integration for Threat Detection and Response
# Overview
This project integrates Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) in a Windows environment. It aims to automate threat detection and incident response to improve security efficiency.

# Scope
EDR Setup: Monitor and detect threats on Windows endpoints.
SOAR Integration: Automate incident response with customized playbooks.
Attack Simulation: Test the integration with simulated threats.

# Lab Setup
Components:
- Windows Endpoint: For EDR monitoring.
- SOAR Platform: (e.g., Splunk Phantom, Cortex XSOAR).
- EDR Solution: (e.g., Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike Falcon).
- Simulated Threats: Metasploit, Atomic Red Team.


# Prerequisites
- Basic Windows and cybersecurity knowledge.
- A working SOAR and EDR setup.
- Tools like Python, Metasploit for simulations.


# Installation
1. EDR: Install EDR on a Windows machine.
2. SOAR: Set up SOAR and configure API connections with the EDR.
3. Automation: Implement playbooks for automatic responses to alerts.


# Usage
1. Detect: EDR identifies a threat.
2. Respond: SOAR triggers a playbook (quarantine, notify, report).
3. Test: Simulate attacks to validate detection and response.


# Troubleshooting
- Verify SOAR-EDR API integration.
- Check network connectivity.
- Confirm playbook triggers.
